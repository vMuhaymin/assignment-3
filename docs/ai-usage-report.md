# 🤖 AI Usage Report

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** – Primary AI assistant used throughout the development of Assignment 2 for debugging, code improvement, API integration help, and documentation.
- **GitHub Copilot (optional)** – Occasionally used for small auto-completions inside VS Code.

---

## 💡 Use Cases
| Category | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **React Hooks & Component Logic** | AI helped me understand and apply hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useMemo` correctly. |
| **Debugging Errors** | ChatGPT assisted with issues in the Services Carousel, contact form validation, and GitHub API integration. |
| **API Integration** | AI guided me through safely integrating the GitHub REST API, error-handling patterns, and correct fetch usage inside React. |
| **Code Refactoring** | My original code was large and unorganized—AI helped restructure it into reusable components (Header, Footer, ProjectsGrid, etc.). |
| **Performance Tips** | AI suggested optimizations such as memoizing static data and avoiding inline heavy computations. |
| **Documentation** | AI assisted in organizing and polishing the README, technical documentation, and this usage report. |

## 🚀 Benefits of AI Assistance
- Faster debugging and issue resolution.  
- Improved understanding of React logic flow and component structure.  
- Cleaner, more modular, and maintainable code.  
- Higher-quality documentation.  
- Better error-handling and safer API design patterns.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Some AI suggestions required modification to fit my project's architecture.  
- Ensuring the GitHub API logic worked without exposing tokens in frontend code.  
- Verifying all AI-generated snippets worked inside the React + Vite environment.

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened my understanding of **React Hooks** and component lifecycle.  
- Learned safe API integration practices (avoiding exposing secrets in .env).  
- Improved debugging workflow with structured problem-solving.  
- Gained experience writing professional documentation.

---

## ✅ Ethical & Responsible AI Use
All AI-generated content was:
- Reviewed and edited manually.
- Understood before being added.
- Adapted to meet project needs.
- Not used as a replacement for my own work.

This ensures academic integrity and genuine learning.

---

## 🏁 Summary
AI tools meaningfully contributed to:
- Improving code quality  
- Fixing logic errors  
- Enhancing the UI/UX  
- Guiding API integration  
- Creating professional documentation  

AI was used responsibly as a **support tool** to improve productivity and learning—not as a substitute for personal understanding.
